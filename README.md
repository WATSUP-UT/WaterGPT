Example 1 - Missing data imputation
-----------

Upload the [flow excel file](data)

> **User:** *plot the attached data*.

> **ChatGPT:** *Here is the plot of the flow data over time based on the provided dataset.*

> <img src="data/flow_missing_data_output1.png" alt="output1" width="500" height="300">

> **User:** fill in the missing flow data based on the daily pattern, plot again, and indicate the filled in data using red color

> **ChatGPT:** *Here is the updated plot showing the flow data over time, with missing values filled based on the daily pattern.* 

> <img src="data/flow_missing_data_output2.png" alt="output1" width="500" height="300">



Example 2 - Importing, processing, and visualizing asset data
-----------

Upload the [pipes and junctions files](data)

> **User:** *open the zip files and examine the files*.

> **ChatGPT:** *the contents of the zip files are as follows: ...These files are components of shapefiles typically used in geographic information systems (GIS) for mapping and spatial analysis. Would you like to explore the data within these files further? â€‹.*

> **User:** *...*.

> **ChatGPT:** *...*
